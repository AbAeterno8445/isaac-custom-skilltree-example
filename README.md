# Custom Skill Tree Example

Small mod example that implements a new basic skill tree, adding it to Tainted Isaac. Uses a custom image as well.

Showcases usage of [SkillTreesAPI](https://github.com/AbAeterno8445/passive-skill-trees-DEV/blob/dev/docs/api.md) from the Passive Skill Trees mod.

In this mod, a small skill tree is added to Tainted Isaac with 4 new numbered nodes, which come from a custom image. Only 'Example Node 1' has an effect, which is "Adds 5 coins when starting a run".
